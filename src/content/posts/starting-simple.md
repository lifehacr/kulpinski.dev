Hey!

I've been putting off starting a blog for the longest time. There was always this nagging thought in the back of my mind: "I gotta make the blog look super slick before I even type a word."

That kind of thinking was a total creativity-killer. All the cool stuff I wanted to share just kind of fizzled out and got forgotten because I was too hung up on looks.

Then it hit me. Who needs a fancy-pants blog to start writing? Not me. Worrying about design? Yeah, I used to be all about that. I've got over it now.

I figured the best kind of blog is the kind that lets me just write, no frills attached. So, I went for simplicity—maybe tipped the scale a bit too much, but it’s cool.

That's pretty much it. The main thing is, I'm writing at last.
